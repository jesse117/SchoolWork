# Purpose

Introduce 3 principles to help understand and explain patterns of behavior. Theses principles help avoid 3 pitfalls that plague decision makers in everyday life.

# Scarcity Principle (No-Free-Lunch)

Summary: Although we have boundless needs and wants, the resources avialable to us are limited. So having more of one good thing usually means having less of another.

# Cost-Benefit Principle

Summary: An individual (or a firm or a society) should take an action if, and only if, the extra (marginal) benefits from taking the action are at least as great as the extra (marginal) costs.

# Incentive Prinicple

Summary: A person (or a firm or a society) is more likely to take an action if its benefits rises, and less likely to take it if its cost risies.

# Pitfalls

1. Measuring costs or benefits proportionally.
2. Ignoring implicit costs
3. Failing to think at the margin.
