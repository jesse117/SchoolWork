# Purpose

This chapter explores how markets allocates food, housing, and other goods and services, usually with remarkable efficiency despite the complexity of the tasks. 

# Central Planning vs the Market

No society can escape basic economic questions:
* How much of our limited time and other resources should we devote to building housing, how much to the production of food, and how much to providing goods and services?
* What techniques should we use to produce each good?
* Who should be assigned to each specific task?
* How much should the resulting goods and services be distributed among people?

Issues have been decided in one of two ways:
1. For all economic decisions to be made centrally, by an individual or small number of individuals on behalf of a larger group.
2. Production and distribution decisions are left to indiviudals interacting in private markets.

**Markets have replaced centralized control because they tend to assign prodicition tasks and consumption benefits much more effectively.** The majority believes that markets are the most effective means for allocating society's scarse resources.
