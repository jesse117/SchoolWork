# Purpose

Introduce 3 principles to help understand and explain patterns of behavior. Theses principles help avoid 3 pitfalls that plague decision makers in everyday life.

# Scarcity Principle (No-Free-Lunch)

Summary: Although we have boundless needs and wants, the resources avialable to us are limited. So having more of one good thing usually means having less of another.

# Cost-Benefit Principle

Summary: An individual (or a firm or a society) should take an action if, and only if, the extra (marginal) benefits from taking the action are at least as great as the extra (marginal) costs.

# Incentive Prinicple

Summary: A person (or a firm or a society) is more likely to take an action if its benefits rises, and less likely to take it if its cost risies.

# Pitfalls

1. Measuring costs or benefits proportionally.
   * Absolute  dollar amounts, not proportions, should be employed to measure costs and benefits
   * Example: (($20) vs ($10 + transporation costs) for an alarm clock) vs (($2010) vs ($2000 + tranportation costs) for a laptop), assuming transportation costs are the same for both instances.
2. Ignoring implicit costs
   * When performing cost-benefit analysis of an action, it's important to account for all relevant costs, including implicit values of alternatives that must be forgone in order to carry out the action. 
3. Failing to think at the margin.
   * Important to ignore sunk costs - costs that cannot be avoided even if no/alternate action is taken.
   * The only costs that should influence a decision are those that can be avoided by not taking an action. The only benefits that should infuence a decision are those that would now occur unless the action were taken.
   * Example: spent $100 on a concert ticket - the money spent shouldn't influence whether or to go to the concert.
